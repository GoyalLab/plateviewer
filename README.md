# 96-Well Plate Viewer (PyQt)

This desktop application allows you to browse 96-well image datasets from high-content microscopy (e.g., Incucyte) using an intuitive plate-based interface.

## Features

* Plate overview with clickable wells arranged in standard 8√ó12 layout
* Thumbnail previews of the most recent image per well
* Full-resolution zoomable view per well with timepoint toggling
* Well annotation options: **Singlet \[1]**, **Doublet \[2]**, **Inconclusive \[3]**
* Colored ring indicators on plate view based on annotations
* Keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation

## File Format Requirements

Each image filename must include:

* The word `plate` (case-insensitive), followed by a plate identifier (e.g., `PLATE01`)
* A well ID in the format `A1`‚Äì`H12`
* A timepoint in the format `00d00h00m`

**Example:**

```
20250117_MEM1003_plate01_A7_1_12d23h59m.tif
```

Other filename content is allowed, but the three components above must be present.
